# Hi I am Jardel Mitchell

I am currently a JR. SuccessFactors Associate, with a background in tech and an interest in cloud development and web based applications.
Technology being a field with near endless possibilities continues to inspire me to learn and try various things. My goal is to understand and continously learn various aspects of tech and the world we live in.
I'm always down for collaborations as long as my schedule allows it and if you're shy, i say "Hello, is the start of many great things".
